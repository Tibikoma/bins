  <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>
  		<p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at<br>high speed. They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured. </p>
  <h2>Attack</h2>
  		<p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be spearers or<br> smashers.</p>
			<p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey,<br> and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
  <h3>Eyesight</h3>
  		<p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about<br> independently of each other. They are considered to be the most<br> complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p>
			<p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both<br> polarized light, and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
